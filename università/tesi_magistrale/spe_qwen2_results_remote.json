The head is depicted as a circular shape with a small, curved line extending from the top, representing the hair or a headband. Below the head, there is a horizontal line that forms the body of the figure. This line is thicker at the bottom and tapers towards the top, giving it a dynamic, flowing appearance. The body extends downward from the head, forming a V-shape that curves outward and then inward again, creating a sense of movement and fluidity.\n\nThe background of the image is white, providing a stark contrast to the black lines of the figure, making the figure stand out prominently. The overall style of the image is minimalist and modern, focusing on the essential lines and shapes that define the figure without any additional details or embellishments.",

These smaller rectangles are connected by a horizontal line at the bottom, forming a sort of \"V\" shape. The bottom section of the large rectangle also contains three smaller rectangles, arranged in a similar vertical alignment, but they are connected by a horizontal line at the top, forming a mirrored \"V\" shape to the top section.\n\nSurrounding these central shapes are four additional rectangles, two on the left and two on the right. These rectangles are positioned symmetrically around the central shape, creating a balanced composition. Each of these outer rectangles is connected to the central shape by a horizontal line, ensuring that all the shapes are interconnected.\n\nThe overall structure of the image resembles a diamond or a square with rounded edges, where the central shape is the largest and most prominent element.

It is the central part of the system and is responsible for generating the motion that is transferred to the follower.\n\n2. **Follower**: The follower is a rectangular piece that slides along the cam's surface. It has a slot on its top edge that aligns with the cam's groove, allowing it to move back and forth as the cam rotates. The follower is connected to a mechanism or a link arm that can perform work based on the motion generated by the cam.\n\n3. **Support Structure**: There is a rectangular support structure at the bottom of the image. This structure likely supports the cam and follower, ensuring they remain stationary during the motion process. It has two vertical sides and a horizontal base, providing stability and support to the cam and follower.\n\n4. **Guide Rail**: At the top of the image, there is a guide rail. This rail is likely used to ensure that the follower moves in a straight line as it slides along the cam. The guide",
