Adjacent to this central pentagon, there's a larger pentagonal shape formed by extending the original edges outward. The outer edges have slight curves as well, making the overall figure look like a series of overlapping pentagons. In between these two pentagonal structures, there are additional elements resembling triangles and trapezoids. These forms are created using straight lines and arcs connecting various points around the central pentagon. A key feature is the presence of a thin strip along the right side of the main pentagonal shape, which consists of horizontal lines and curved segments.
