This advanced modular\narchitectureintegratesmultipleprocessingtechniquestooptimizetheunderstanding\nand description of SVG documents.\n3.2.1 Visual Path (Raster Path)\nThe visual path utilizes the Swin Transformer V2 architecture to process the raster\nrepresentation of the SVG. This architectural choice offers several advantages:\n• Local attention with sliding windows: Ideal for capturing visual hierar-\nchies in SVGs\n• Computational efficiency: Linear complexity compared to the quadratic\ncomplexity of traditional Vision Transformers\n• Multi-scale support: Native handling of SVG elements at different detail\nscales\nThe visual path processes the SVG through the following steps:\n1. Rasterization: ConversionoftheSVGtohigh-resolutionrasterimage(512x512\npixels)\n2. Preprocessing: Normalization and augmentation of visual data\n3. Feature Extraction: Use of Swin Transformer V2 for extracting hierarchical\nvisual features\n",
