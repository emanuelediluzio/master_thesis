## Solutions

The solution to this question can be found on StackOverflow, and it's very easy to find! Here is one:

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It allows you to create drawings using vector graphics rather than bitmap images (such as JPEGs). In order to make your drawing scalable, you need to use the correct units when specifying dimensions. For example, if you want to draw a circle with radius 100 pixels, you would write &lt;circle cx="50" cy="50" r="100"/&gt; instead of just writing &lt;circle cx="50" cy="50" r="100"/&gt;

What does this mean?

• First off, let’s break down what each part of our code means:
• “M” – This specifies that we’re going about to move from point A to point B. If we were starting at point C instead of point D, then we could say M(C,D) instead.
• “L” – This means that we’ll now start moving along line segments between points until told otherwise by another command such as “Z”.

Two smaller trees are positioned slightly to the left and right of the main tree trunk. Both trees have trunks made of two horizontal segments followed by diagonal lines, giving them a 3D appearance. The left tree's coordinates are approximately (16,157), while the right tree's coordinates are around (496,434).

Below the main tree, a wide yellow rectangle is drawn, suggesting grass or a sandy area. This rectangle extends horizontally across the entire width of the drawing.

Several additional shapes contribute to the overall composition. A smaller, darker rectangle represents a rock-like object near the bottom of the illustration. There are also several irregularly shaped objects along the edges, which could represent bushes or plants.
MODEL[Gemma-9b instruct]: The image depicts a bustling scene of green trees against a white background.

**Foreground:** A large, solid green rectangle represents a hill or mound. On this hill, there is a small black circle outlining a window.

**Background:** The dominant feature is a tall, slender green tree positioned to the right of the hill. Its trunk is thin and straight, gradually widening towards its crown. The leaves at the top form a rounded shape.  There's a smaller, similar green tree positioned further to the left, slightly behind the larger one. Both trees have a distinct, minimalist design, emphasizing their verticality.

**Additional Elements:**

* A single white circle sits at the bottom center of the image.
* There are three dark grey rectangles scattered around the central area, resembling tiny houses or structures.

**Overall Impression:**

The image evokes a sense of simplicity and tranquility. The stark contrast between the bright white background and the vibrant green trees creates a visually appealing composition.
MODEL[Llama-8b]: The image depicts a simple, rectangular shape with rounded corners, commonly known as a "rectangle." The rectangle is outlined by a solid black line, which provides a clear and visible distinction between the interior and exterior of the object. The rectangle is positioned against a white background, which makes the edges of the object stand out prominently, allowing for easy perception of its shape and dimensions. The corner radius of the rectangle is such that the corners are slightly rounded, giving the object a softer and more rounded appearance compared to a traditional sharp-cornered rectangle. The overall structure of the object is symmetrical, with both the vertical and horizontal dimensions being equal, resulting in a square with rounded corners. The boundary of the object is smooth and consistent, with no irregularities or juts, making it a clean and well-defined 2D shape. The context of the image suggests that the rectangle is intended for graphical or visual representation, possibly in a digital or printed medium, where its simplicity and straight lines make it a popular choice for design elements such as borders, frames, or sections. The object's integrity is apparent, with no cracks, chips, or other damages visible, indicating its potential for widespread use and reliability.
MODEL[Gemma-9b-Quantized]: The image depicts a whimsical scene with three main figures.

The largest figure is a plump white bird with outstretched wings. Its body is outlined by a smooth curve, while its head is rounded with a small beak. The bird's wings span wide, creating a sense of grandeur and movement.

On the right side of the bird, a smaller green frog sits perched on a lily pad. The frog has bulging eyes and a long tongue, characteristic of its species. The lily pad is depicted as a simple circle, offering a platform for the frog to rest upon.

Below the bird and frog, a more intricate figure stands upright. This figure resembles a human with a black silhouette.
MODEL[Llama-9b-Quantized]: The black dot is an ant, crawling on top of a white sphere. There's a red circle above them both. The black dot walks clockwise around its path (counterclockwise if you look at it from behind), and the red circle rotates counterclockwise. The ant has moved three full rotations already.

MODEL[SPE+Gemma-9b v2]: The image depicts a stylized figure resembling a person standing upright with arms outstretched. The figure is primarily composed of white, green, and black shapes.

**Key Elements:**

* **Body:**  The main body of the figure is formed by a large white rectangle extending from the top to the bottom. This suggests the torso and legs of the figure.
* **Head:** The head is represented by a smaller white rectangle positioned at the top of the body.
* **Arms:** Two long, thin green lines extend outward from the sides of the body, forming the arms. These lines taper towards the ends, suggesting hands.
* **Legs:** While the legs are implied by the shape of the white rectangle, they are not explicitly defined.
* **Details:**
* A black circle near the top of the head could represent an eye.
* There are several additional small black rectangles scattered around the figure's form, which might be intended as facial features or other details.

**Overall Impression:**

The image presents a minimalist and abstract representation of a human figure.
