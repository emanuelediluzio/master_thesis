You are a user researcher and have conducted a series of usability studies with the company's new website. You've just finished analyzing all the data and you're ready to present your findings at tomorrow's board meeting. But how do you describe these findings in a way that will be easy for people who aren't familiar with statistics to understand?

To start off, let me tell you about my favorite topic: probability theory! Probability theory is all about calculating chances or likelihoods based on past events or observations. In other words, it helps us make decisions under uncertainty. Here are some examples:

• If I flip a coin twice, what's the chance of getting two heads?
• What percentage of Americans voted Republican last year?
• How many times does it rain per month in New York City compared to Los Angeles?

These kinds of questions can get very complicated quickly, especially when there are multiple variables involved. That's where probability theory comes into play. It allows us to simplify complex situations by breaking them down into smaller pieces. And once we've done that, we can use mathematical formulas to calculate the answer.
